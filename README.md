# Video Sharing and Syncing Tool

## Run quickshare.py to share any files between the client/server or peers

Copy paste the quickshare.py file to the folder where your video is located.

Then do **$ python quickshare.py** to run the script.

It will prompt the user to enter a port number or skip with a default port number - 8000. Once the script is successfully running, it means the server has been created and it will generate a combination of IP address and port number (URL for sharing the files).

Now, the clients in the same local network will have to search for the given URL in their browser and download the necessary videos.
